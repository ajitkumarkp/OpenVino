Using script's current directory (/opt/altera/aocl-pro-rte/aclrte-linux64)

aoc was not found, but aocl was found. Assuming only RTE is installed.

AOCL_BOARD_PACKAGE_ROOT is set to /opt/intel/openvino/bitstreams/a10_vision_design_sg2_bitstreams/BSP/a10_1150_sg2. Using that.

aocl program - Configures a new FPGA design onto your board


Usage: aocl program <device_name> <file.aocx>

   Supply the .aocx file for the design you wish to configure onto 
   the FPGA.  You need to provide <device_name> to specify the FPGA 
   device to configure with. 

Description:

   This command downloads a new design onto your FPGA.
   This utility should not normally be used, users should instead use 
   clCreateProgramWithBinary to configure the FPGA with the .aocx file.
