## What it Does
At a high level the project involves:
1. Proposing a possible hardware solution for smart queuing under different scenarios- Retail, Manufacturing and Transportation.
2. Building an application and testing its performance on Intel DevCloud using multiple hardware types- CPU, iGPU, VPU and FPGA.
3. Comparing the performance to see which hardware is best suited for different scenarios.


### Setup
Intel DevCloud Platform
